Exercise 2:
Solution: The last 4 buffer overflows can be exploited in this manner.

Exercise 4:
Solution: Other buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited in the same manner, except fot the first two.

Exercise 5:
I find it hard to find more bugs, excluding the bugs found in bugs.txt.
I just use 2 bugs previously found.

1) the "reqpath" can be overflowed to hijiack the control flow.
   the limitation is obvious: it depends on the convetion of the c calling and the stupid "ret" instruction.
   the attacker can use overflow the "reqpath" to hijack the control of flow, which is dangerous.
   Various ways can be used to prevent it, including ASLR and stack canary.
   I could simply use the boundry check to fix the bug. 

2) the "value" also can be overflowed to hijijack the control flow.
   Same limitiantion, prevention.

Exercise 6:
Some type modifications are showed below.

1) sprinf --> snprinf
2) int buf[1024] --> static int buf[1024]
3) strcat --> strncat
